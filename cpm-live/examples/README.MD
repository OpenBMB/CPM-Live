# Examples

we provide examples of adapting CPM-Ant to downstream tasks on [CUGE benchmark](http://cuge.baai.ac.cn) using *delta tuning*.

For convenience, we have preprocessed the datasets, and you can download them from [here](https://openbmb.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/model_center/cuge_ant/cuge_data.zip)!

Then, for example, you can run the following command to tune CPM-Ant on CCPM dataset:

```
bash scripts/CCPM.sh
```
